# Assignment 2

"A Musical Toy" 

![](images/cybertrad.png.jpg)

For this individual assignment you will be exploring musical play and experimentation, by creating a virtual musical instrument using Godot. 

This will be a screen where you press buttons, move sliders and it makes different sounds etc. It could be a toy that you give to baby brother or sister to entertain them on an ipad that makes animal sounds with pictures, or it could have more complexity and expressiveness. 

Your project should demonstrate:

- At least one scene with a nice looking user interface design
- Some interactivity with buttons connected up to some code that make sounds
- An array
- A loop
- An if statement
- Doing some basic stuff with Godot
- Making git commits

## Rubric

| Category | Weighting | 1 | 2.1 | 2.2 | Pass | Fail |
|----------|-----------|--------|----|----|----|----|
| Complexity | 33% | For loops and arrays. Use of different systems in Godot. A lot of new nodes created. Complex UI interaction such as drag and drop, timers, UI controls. UI created procedurally. Lots of variety in the sounds created. Use of controllers or external input. The instrument is "programmable". Sound is generated procedurally. Excellent visual feedback | Simple UI based on clicking buttons to make sounds. Use of loops and at least one array. Use of timers. UI is generated in editor.  No external input. Good variety of sounds. Based on a real instrument | A basic soundboard with buttons to make sounds | Forked the repo, made some commits, not much working, but it makes a sound | Failed to fork the repo, no commits made |
| Aesthetic | 33% | Novel user interface for creating live sound. Complex button and knob arrangement. High quality of visual design. Original, high quality assets produced. Original  recorded audio. Visually coherent and easy to use. Great variety of musical expressiveness. Sounds are interesting and coherent. Crazy and beautiful and lots of novelty | Straightforward, intuitive interface with a reasonable amount of control of a good range of sound. Ability to perform live with a good degree of expression. Some simple assets created. | Basic interface with one screen. Some assets made and some acquired from online sources. Not too much variety in the expressiveness of the instrument | Simple or unintuitive user interface. User interface made from premade assets. Sound are premade or made using simple tools | Basic user interface that makes sound, without any expressiveness or novelty or much fun. | Project doesnt make any sound
| Documentation | 33% | Large number of commits. Good quality video demo and good documentation, with all sections completed. Commits evenly spaced throughout the project | Smaller number of commits over a shorter period of time, but a good bit of work evident in the latter weeks of the project. Video and documentation completed to high standard | All done in week or two before the delivery date. Lots of commits in last two weeks. Documentation incomplete or video incomplete. | All done in the final week. Incomplete documentation or video. Few commits | No use of git. project doesnt work |

Form a team of max 5 people and develop a piece of generative art using Processing & Python inspired by the any of the following ideas:

- YM2413 Sound Chip
- The Number 52: "I love the number 52. I had an intern when I worked at MicroCabin. He always did an impression of his uncle who ran lotteries. He always called the number 52; that's why I came to like it. Patrol cars driving around the city often have a  number. I fantasized about such cars; about a car with the number 52, which was the fastest of all cars
- Wave Injection: "The title of "Wave Injection" that I am presenting this time was born from my desire to continue to be a "Wave" (sound and wave) emitting device. Everyone! Enjoy forever! Create forever!"
- MSXGOTO40
- The Story of DANI. The AI Chatbot from 1987 that arrives in 2023. See http://bryanduggan.org

The piece can last up to 1 minute. You can use any combination of: 

- HSB Colour space, procedurally generating colours
- Laying elements with alpha
- Drawing using line, circle, ellipse etc
- 3D Shapes
- 8 Bit style graphics
- Movement
- Spinning logos
- Making classes for visual elements

A selection of the projects will be displayed during Nito San's music performance on the msx MSX at MSXGOTO40, Amsterdam on Dec 9, 2023. In order to be eligible you must complete your project by 1 December 2023. This assignment is worth 25% of your overall grade.

You can work on the project during lab time on Mondays and expected to do work outside of class. Make a github repository for your project, so you can collaborate. Each team member should make commits on the repository as evidence of work. 

## Grading:

You will be graded based on the following criteria:

- Creativity, originality and novelty in the visual elements and overall visual design: 35%
- Technical proficiency in using Processing & Python 35%
- Collaboration and teamwork in dividing tasks and managing the project using Github: 15%
- Quality and professionalism of the final program and video presentation: 15%

## Rubric

| Grade | Description |
| ------|-------------|
| First | Looks beautiful, colours work really well together. All the visual elements combine well. Close adherence to the theme and excellent use of storytelling, progression in the project. Deep knowledge of source material evident. Visually complex with many interacting elements. Technically complex with use of classes, vectors and transforms. Great teamwork. All team members making documented commits. Lots of self directed learning. Great documentation and video demo. All team members making commits on the repo. Great teamwork evident |
| 2.1 | The assignment is fairly complex with some elements interacting in a straight-forward way such as colours changing or shapes changing size. There is a some movement. You have added a few features that you have had to learn some programming stuff for. You made or programmed all the art assets but maybe got some stuff online too. Your colours are good but could use some improvement to make them more beautiful. You have used classes, but maybe not inheritance & polymorphism. Good documentation and all team members making commented commits |
| 2.2 | The assignment isn't complex and is mostly based on modifying the examples we developed in the class. Your documentation is minimal and little evidence of good project management. Development on the project was rushed and you left everything until the week before the submission deadline. There are are incomplete features or things you planned to get working and couldn't. No youtube video or minimal documentation. |
| Pass | Something very basic that is just a small modification of the code we developed in the class. Missing documentation. Completed in the days before the submission deadline and minimal or missing documentation. |
| Fail | Project won't compile or major issues. |
